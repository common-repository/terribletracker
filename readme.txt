== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have to enter an UA-code, how do I get one? =
Unfortunately it's impossible to create a Google Analytics property through the API, so no plugin can do that for you. You have to visit Google Analytics manually to create a property after logging in. After creating a property in Google Analytics they provide you with an UA-code. Simply copy+paste the UA-code into Terribletracker and you'll start tracking your site.
